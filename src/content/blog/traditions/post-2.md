Babylonians marked the beginning of a new year with the first new moon following the vernal equinox, a day in late March with an equal amount of sunlight and darkness. They celebrated with an 11-day festival called Akitu, which involved rituals to honor the sky god Marduk."

            text: "In ancient Rome, the calendar was realigned by Julius Caesar in 46 B.C., setting January 1st as the start of the new year. Named after Janus, the Roman god of beginnings and endings, this day was celebrated with sacrifices and promises of good conduct for the coming year. This shift laid the groundwork for the modern Gregorian calendar and its widespread acceptance."
