title: "The Twelve Labors of Hercules II: The Hydra's Heads"
subtitle: "The Regenerating Serpent"
description: "The Lernaean Hydra was a monstrous serpent-like creature with multiple heads. It dwelled in the swamps near the ancient town of Lerna in the Argolid region of Greece. The Hydra was a fearsome beast, and what made it even more formidable was its regenerative ability. Whenever one of its heads was cut off, two more would grow in its place."
