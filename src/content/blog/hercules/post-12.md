In this task, Hercules is commanded by King Eurystheus to go to the Underworld and capture Cerberus, the three-headed dog guarding the entrance, without using any weapons.

He traveled to Eleusis, where he underwent initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a secretive religious rite. This initiation was crucial, as it provided Hercules with the spiritual guidance and protection needed for his journey into the afterlife. It also symbolized Hercules' readiness to face death, a necessary step for one who would confront Hades himself."
