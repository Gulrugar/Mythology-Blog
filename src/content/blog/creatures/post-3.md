subtitle: We Who Shun the Light
description: "In ancient civilizations, tales of vampiric creatures were prevalent, often associated with demonic entities or restless spirits preying on the living. These early myths, found in cultures like Mesopotamia and ancient Greece, depicted vampirism as a manifestation of evil spirits or a punishment from the gods, instilling fear and caution among the people."
