In Mesopotamian folklore, demons were often responsible for disease and suffering, while in ancient Egyptian beliefs, they could be both protectors or malevolent entities causing chaos. The concept further evolved with Zoroastrianism, one of the earliest forms of monotheism, which depicted demons as agents of chaos working against the divine order."

They don't have a physical existence but serve as spiritual obstacles to attaining enlightenment. Thus, the role of demons in religious texts varies, but they are often involved in the eternal battle between good and evil."

They have been everything from scapegoats for the unexplained to metaphors for our innermost fears and desires. Whether seen as real entities or symbolic constructs, the concept of demons seems deeply rooted in the human psyche, reflecting our eternal struggle with the unknown, the chaotic, and the malevolent."
