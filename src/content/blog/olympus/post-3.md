On the very day of his birth in a cave on Mount Cyllene, he ventured out, displaying an astonishingly precocious character. His first notable exploit was the theft of his brother Apollo's cattle. Ingeniously, Hermes reversed their hooves and led them backwards, making it difficult for anyone to track them."
