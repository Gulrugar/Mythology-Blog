Hera, Zeus' wife, out of spite, had forbidden Leto to give birth on any land under the sun. However, the floating island of Delos provided a refuge, where Leto bore Apollo and his twin sister, Artemis. This narrative sets the stage for Apollo’s complex character, embodying both the light of deliverance and the shadows of conflict."

Mere days after his birth, he slew Python, a primordial serpent that terrorized Delos, establishing his role as a protector and avenger. This act not only signified his might but also prefigured his association with prophecy, as Python guarded the oracular sanctuary that Apollo would later claim and sanctify as the Oracle of Delphi."

The prophetic utterances delivered here shaped the destinies of individuals and city-states, marking Apollo as a pivotal figure in the spiritual and political life of ancient Greece."
