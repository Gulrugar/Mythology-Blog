He is most commonly recognized as the son of Zeus, the king of the gods, and Hera, the queen of the gods, although some myths suggest he was born from Hera alone, in retaliation for Zeus giving birth to Athena without her. This version of his birth highlights the ongoing power struggles and the desire for independence and individual achievement among the gods."

After being born, he was cast out of heaven by Hera, disgusted by his physical imperfection, or, in another version, by Zeus, for taking Hera's side in an argument. This fall from Olympus not only signifies the challenges Hephaestus faced from the moment of his birth but also sets the stage for his role as a bridge between the divine and the mortal worlds, embodying themes of resilience and redemption."

Hephaestus' favor towards mortals is perhaps best exemplified by his assistance to the hero Prometheus in the theft of fire, an act that enabled the progress of civilization but also led to Prometheus' eternal punishment."
